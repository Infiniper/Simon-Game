# Simon-Game
Simon is an electronic game of short-term memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, working for toy design firm Marvin Glass and Associates, with software programming by Lenny Cope. The game creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence.

In the Simon game, players must repeat a randomly generated sequence of colored lights and sounds by pressing the corresponding buttons on the device in the exact order they saw and heard, with the sequence increasing in length with each round, until a player makes a mistake and is eliminated; the goal is to remember the longest sequence possible to win the game. 

Key rules:

Sequence generation:

The Simon device randomly flashes a sequence of colored lights, accompanied by corresponding sounds. 

Player response:

Players must press the buttons on the device in the exact order that the lights flashed, matching the colors and sounds. 

Progression:

After each correct sequence, the game adds one more light to the pattern, making it longer and more difficult. 

Losing the game:

If a player presses a wrong color or misses a color in the sequence, the game ends.
